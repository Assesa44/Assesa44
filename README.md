### 👩🏾‍💻 About Me

I’m a curious and driven data science student with a passion for transforming messy data into meaningful stories. Whether I’m scraping product reviews, visualizing trends, or applying NLP to uncover customer sentiment, I bring persistence, creativity, and a love for learning into every project.

I'm currently building a strong portfolio through real-world projects — from e-commerce review analysis to cult movie predictors — while sharpening my skills in Python, Tableau, and exploratory analysis.

### ⚡ Fun Fact

I once spent 2 days debugging a web scraper, thought I’d given up, and then came back to scrape 350 reviews in one night. Data science teaches you patience… and revenge 😌
